Description: This package contains a PAM module that performs a crude
 check on a SAML authentication assertion. The assertion signature and date
 are verified, and access is granted on behalf to the user taken for a
 configurable attribute.
 .
 The only protection against replay attacks is the assertion validity dates
 checks, this authentication is therefore secure only if the SAML
 authentication assertion remains secret. The assertion has the same role
 as a web cookie used for authentication.
