.SH NAME
pam_saml \- Crude SAML assertion verification module for PAM
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pam_saml
is a Plugable Authentication Module (PAM) which will validate 
authentication based on a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 
authentication assertion. This allows a web server to use the
SAML assertion as some kind of ticket for getting authenticated access
to some other resource which is protected by PAM.
.LP
Of course this authentication scheme is rather clumsy, as the whole 
security collapse if any valid SAML assertion is known to an attacker.
Encrypted communications between client and web server are advised, and 
.B pam_saml
also attempts to thwart the most obvious replay attacks, by performing
a few checks on the data available in the SAML assertion. The verification
performed are:
.LP
.TP
Identity provider (IdP) signature validity. This prevents an attacker 
from forging a SAML assertion.
.TP
Date validity, with a grace period for gracefully handling clock skews.
This revents replays using a very old assertion that has been disclosed.
.TP
Optionnaly, the IdP-specified assertion audience can be restricted to a
set of Service Providers (SP). This prevents an attacker from using an
assertion collected on an other weak SP that does not use encrypted 
communications with the client.
.SH PAM CONFIGURATION
Configuration is done in /etc/pam.conf or /etc/pam.d. The following options
are available:
.LP
.TP 
.B
userid=<uid_attribute>
Check the value of the
.B uid_attribute
attribute in the SAML assertion against the authenticating user login.
Default is 
.B uid
.TP
.B 
grace=<time>
When checking assertion time validity, use a 
.B time
grace delay (in seconds) to work around minor clock skews. Default it
.B 600 s
.TP
.B
saml_check_assertion_timeframe={0|1}
When checking assertion time validity, check
.B Assertion/Conditions@NotOnOrAfter  
(Default is to check it).
.TP
.B
saml_check_session_timeframe={0|1}
When checking assertion time validity, check
.B Assertion/AuthnStatement@SessionNotOnOrAfter  
(Default is to check it).
.TP
.B 
idp=<path>
Load SAML metadata for a trusted IdP from 
.B path .
This option can be used multiple times, to use several IdP. This option
is mandatory, otherwise no assrertion will be validated at all.
.TP
.B
cacert=<path>
Use the certificates from
.B path
as the certificate authorities. This option cannot be used multiple times,
but the certificate file can contain multiple certificates.
.TP
.B
trusted_sp=<provider_id>
In order to be validated, the assertion must have its audience set to 
.B provider_id .
This is optional and can be specified multiple times. If the option is
not specifie, the audience is not checked.
cified multiple times.
.TP
.B
only_from=<hosts>
This module will only perform its checks for a remote host present in the
comma-separated lists specified in
.B hosts .
If this option is not specified, the module is enabled for any host.
